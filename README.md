### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With over 15 years of work experience in business and IT roles, I am currently the Managing Director at Inetpub LTD, an IT consulting company. I have been in this position since December 2016. I have worked on an ERP system implementation project, leveraging my expertise in SAP products, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and business analysis. I hold SAP Sales and Distribution certification.

I'm now going through a career change from management to a technical position as a Data analyst. I've just obtained a Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification and I'm currently self-studying to sit the Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals certification exam. I'm currently also learning to code, more specifically, I'm deep-diving in my studies to become a proficient Data Scientist through a CoGrammar Bootcamp, which I've been enjoying very much.

Through extensive self-study, hands-on practice, and completion of relevant coursework, Iâ€™m gaining theoretical experience in various aspects of data science, including data loading, transformation, modelling, and visualization. I am eager to apply these skills in real projects and gain valuable hands-on experience.

I'm looking forward to meeting fellow data scientists to whom I'll be able to learn, share experiences and build a network of like-minded people.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find my profile and contact details at https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabianabertini/.

All the best.

Fabiana Bertini
